# DuMang DK6 Keyboard Programming Tools

This is an open-source toolset for use with the DuMang DK6 line of keyboards.

These keyboards are fully programmable and support multiple layers.

It is currently only support for Linux, but will eventually support other
platforms.

There are two implementations planned: one in python and another in C/C++. At
the moment, only the Python one has been implemented. Please see the `python`
directory for more information.
